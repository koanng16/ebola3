<h1><strong>A Story of 2 Ebola Survivors</strong></h1>
<img src="http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Peace/2014/Ebola/ebola-watchful-afp.jpg"
<p> Mohammad and Zena are currently the only 2 survivors in the Ebola Outbreak in Guinea. It all started from their older brother. He was diagnosed with malaria and typhoid fever. He suffered from vomiting, had a fever, respiratory difficulties, and a fatigue. A physician, also a member of the family, arrived to provide first aid in the home. Over a short period of time, his condition worsened and was transported to the hospital, but passed away a couple of days later. His body was sent back to his village. Everybody to helped wash his body, perform funeral rituals, and took care of him all became sick. Ebola hit their family real hard. 9 family members were infected and 6 died. Mohammad and Zena's family were then sented to an isolation ward in Conarky after the doctors found out that they were infected. They both said that when MSF, WHO, medical and nursing staffs joined the local team at the isolation facility. There were more people to care for the sick and they slowly recovered from Ebola. Due to fear of contamination of ebola, both mohammad and Zena have been fired from their original job. Now Mohamed and Zena give talks about what Ebola is, how to prevent infections and emphasize that people who go to health centres can survive. They have become living examples of hope.</p>
