    <h1>History of Ebola</h1>
<p> Ebola is named after Ebola River, which is now named Congo River in Western Central Africa. In 1976, this virus infected about 284 people in Sudan and Zaire.A few months later, the second Ebola virus emerged from Yambuku, Zaire, Ebola-Zaire, infected 318 people. The third strain of Ebola, Ebola Reston, was first identified in 1989 when infected monkeys were imported into Reston, Virginia, from Mindanao in the Philippines. Luckily, the few people who were infected with EBOR never developed Ebola hemorrhagic fever.The last known strain of Ebola, Ebola Cote d'Ivoire was discovered in 1994 when a female ethologist was performing a necropsy on a dead chimpanzee from the Tai Forest, Cote d'Ivoire, accidentally infected herself during the necropsy. </p>
